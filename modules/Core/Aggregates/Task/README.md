What is a task?

A task is a container for a homework, a learning unit or an exam. But the container can have for example more than one homework
or it will have an exam and 10 learning units to solve the exam. 

So this aggregate will become the most complicated - but when the methods are described well what a student or a teacher can do with 
a task, all will be fine.
